# Todo App

---

# Introduction

This is my first project with flask. It consists on a todo list app in which you have to register and can create, delete or change the status of todos.

# Database

It is thought to work with a `**gcloud firestore**` database. Before being able to run it, you’ll have to create your gcloud project and set it as the default using **`gcloud sdk`**.

# Secret key

A `**key**` at app/config.py has to be set. The default is ‘SUPER SECRET’ but it is not recommended at all to use ir.
